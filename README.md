#### Installing RevolutionCMS on IIS
> **Requirements:**
> 
> - Windows OS
> - PHP 5.6 or Higher
> - MySQL 5.1 or Higher

Download [Release 0.0.1](#location) and Unpack the archive to `C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\` or another folder you have setup for IIS to use.

Before you can install RevCMS a new database must be created, for MySQL a tool like [ MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) can be used.

In browser open up `http://<your site>/install.php` for most this will be [http://localhost/install.php](http://localhost/install.php) and follow the installation instruction on the web page.
